    "DATA PREPROCESSING:\n",
    "Data preprocessing is a crucial step in data analysis and machine learning that involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data into a format suitable for analysis or model training. This process typically includes tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, scaling or normalizing features, encoding categorical variables, and splitting data into training and testing sets. Effective data preprocessing can improve the quality and reliability of analytical results and enhance the performance of machine learning models by ensuring that the data is in a suitable form for analysis or modeling."
